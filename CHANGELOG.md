## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-08

The first public ZeoKeel release: a compile-time modular AI agent for the
desktop and the headless/ACP worlds, written in Go and drawn with native mygo
controls (no webview, no browser engine).

### Added

- **Compile-time modular architecture**: one binary, assembly products
  (`desktop` / `headless`), a kernel of contribution points, and `assembly.json`
  entries that enable or trim modules without runtime plugin shipping.
- **Desktop product**: native chat UI with streaming answers, reasoning
  preview, tool cards, session history, workspaces, right-side inspector
  (overview/tools/log/files/changes/terminal/team/tasks), command palette,
  keyboard shortcuts, tray/notification integration and global hotkey.
- **Headless + ACP**: the same binary runs `--headless` (with tools, memory,
  sessions, automations) or as an ACP stdio server for editor integration,
  including image prompt blocks.
- **Agent capabilities**: tools (shell/file/read/edit/todo), approvals and
  permission modes (ask/workspace/full/never), agent/chat modes
  (normal/plan/minimal/creator), subagents and team management, goals with
  continuation, plan review, memos/memory, skills, MCP servers, LSP tools,
  prompt/agent presets, session references and context compaction.
- **Model configuration**: providers and quick presets, per-session model
  switching, per-model thinking configuration for Qwen / DeepSeek / other
  families with custom modes, per-model generation parameters
  (temperature / top_p / max_tokens), runtime limits (max iterations, context
  budget, stream-completeness check) and a model catalog editor.
- **Settings surface**: 19 pages in five groups, with low-frequency advanced
  pages collapsed behind one group; progressive disclosure on the model,
  behavior and model-catalog pages; searchable navigation, fixed footer
  actions and unsaved-changes guards.
- **i18n**: Chinese and English UI, localized errors and date formatting.
- **Packaging**: cross-platform release builds with explicit OS + architecture
  asset names — `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `darwin/amd64`, `darwin/arm64`
  (`.tar.gz`) and `windows/amd64`, `windows/arm64` (`.zip` with `zeokeel.exe`);
  version/commit/build-time injected at link time, `SHA256SUMS.txt` and a
  download table in the release notes; CI on push/PR (including a cross-compile
  check for every release target) and a tag-driven release workflow.

### Fixed

- ACP failures are reported as JSON-RPC errors; interrupted turns persist
  partial assistant output and can be regenerated without losing reasoning.
- Oversized tool results spill to disk for both desktop and headless sessions.
- Truncated model streams are reported instead of silently appearing complete
  (zeokeel-rig `RequireCompleteStream`, v0.13.1).
- Attachment picker runs off the UI thread; manual path fallback for
  portal-less environments; per-conversation composer drafts and attachments.
- Composer action row simplified (attach menu, model, session menu, send);
  narrow-window overflow and session-menu accessibility fixes.
- Memory update/edit, model test-connection details, approval copy, and a
  large batch of UI interaction fixes found by independent audits.

### Verification

- `./scripts/verify.sh` (2026-11-08): **10/10 PASS** — gofmt, build, vet,
  full test suite, `-race`, regression **284 PASS / 0 SKIP / 0 FAIL**, UI
  snapshot (83 steps / 81 PNGs), desktop (Xvfb) / headless / ACP smokes.
- Desktop smoke: window + tray + single instance under Xvfb, no panics.
- Model thinking/generation mapping verified by captured request bodies and
  unit tests; SDK dependency is `github.com/zeokeel/zeokeel-rig v0.13.1`.
